# Olfaction Drivers

ROS2 nodes that communicate with olfaction-related sensors (anemometers and gas sensors) and publish the readings on ROS topics. Clone with the `--recursive` option, since the [serial](https://github.com/wjwwood/serial) package, that some of the drivers depend on, is added as a submodule.
